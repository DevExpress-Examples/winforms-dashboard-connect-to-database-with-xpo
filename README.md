# How to Bind a Dashboard to the XPO Data Source at Design-Time

This example creates a dashboard at design-time, binds it to the [DevExpress.DashboardCommon.DashboardXpoDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardCommon.DashboardXpoDataSource?v=19.2) using the Data Source Wizard and displays it in the [DashboardViewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer) control.
